blaze-persistence
==========
blaze-persistence is a rich Criteria API for JPA providers.

What is it?
===========

blaze-persistence is a rich Criteria API for JPA providers that is better
than all the other Criteria APIs available.
It provides a fluent API for building queries and removes common restrictions
encountered when working with JPA directly.
It offers rich pagination support and also supports keyset pagination.

The entity view module can be used to create views for the JPA entites.
You can roughly imagine an entity view is to an entity, what a RDBMS view is to a table.

How to use it?
==============
Currently you have to build it yourself, but soon we will publish the version 1.0 to
the Maven Central.
