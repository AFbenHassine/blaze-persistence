Test early releases::
We often do some Alpha and Beta releases to bring new features to you early and catch some nasty bugs or design issues. Do some experiments with the releases or switch to the versions in your projects just to see if everything still works smoothly.

Contribute code::
Before you can contribute code, you should setup you environment for developing Blaze-Persistence!

==== Quick setup

Since we are working on GitHub you should start by forking Blaze-Persistence and cloning that repository.

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/blaze-persistence
cd blaze-persistence
----

Blaze-Persistence uses https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven] so make sure you have a current version installed. You can build the project with the default profiles

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean package
----

Development should be possible with any IDE but is probably easiest with https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[IntelliJ] since the Core team also uses that.
