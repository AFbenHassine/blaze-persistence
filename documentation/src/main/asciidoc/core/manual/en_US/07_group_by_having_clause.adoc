== Group by and having clause

The `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clause are closely. Logically the `HAVING` clause is evaluated after the `GROUP BY` clause.
A `HAVING` clause does not make sense without a `GROUP BY` clause.

=== Group by

When a `GROUP BY` clause is used, most DBMS require that every non-aggregate expression that appears in the following clauses must also appear in the `GROUP BY` clause

* `SELECT`
* `ORDER BY`
* `HAVING`

This is due to the fact that these clauses are logically executed after the `GROUP BY` clause.
Some DBMS even go as far as not allowing expressions of a certain complexity in the `GROUP BY` clause. For such expressions,
the property/column references have to be extracted and put into the `GROUP BY` clause instead, so that the composite expressions can be built after grouping.

By default, the use of complex expressions is allowed in link:{core_doc}/persistence/GroupByBuilder.html#groupBy(java.lang.String)[`groupBy()`],
but can be disabled by turning on the <<compatible_mode,compatible mode>>.

NOTE: OpenJPA only supports path expressions and simple function expression in the `GROUP BY` clause

NOTE: Currently it is not possible to have a custom `GROUP BY` and thus also `HAVING` clause when using the `PaginatedCriteriaBuilder` API. Also see https://github.com/Blazebit/blaze-persistence/issues/194[#194]

==== Implicit group by generation

Fortunately all these issues with different DBMS and the `GROUP BY` clause is handled by {projectname} through implicit group by generation.
Implicit group by generation adds just the expressions that are necessary for a query to work on a DBMS without changing it's semantics.
The generation will kick in as soon as

* The `GROUP BY` clause is used
* An aggregate function is used

If you don't like the group by generation or you run into a bug, you can always disable it on a per-query and per-clause basis if you like.

* <<implicit_group_by_from_select,Property for `SELECT` clause>>
* <<implicit_group_by_from_having,Property for `HAVING` clause>>
* <<implicit_group_by_from_order_by,Property for `ORDER BY` clause>>

Let's look at an example

[source,java]
----
CriteriaBuilder<Tuple> cb = cbf.create(em, Tuple.class)
    .from(Cat.class)
    .select("age")
    .select("COUNT(*)");
----

This will result in the following JPQL query

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.age, COUNT(*)
FROM Cat cat
GROUP BY cat.age
----

The grouping is done based on the non-aggregate expressions, in this case, it is just the `age` of the cat.
If you disabled the implicit group by generation for the `SELECT` clause, the `GROUP BY` clause would be missing and you'd have to add it manually like

[source,java]
----
CriteriaBuilder<Tuple> cb = cbf.create(em, Tuple.class)
    .from(Cat.class)
    .select("age")
    .select("COUNT(*)")
    .groupBy("age");
----

which isn't too painful at first, but can get quite cumbersome when having many expressions.

WARNING: Not using implicit group by generation for the `HAVING` clause when using non-trivial expression like e.g. `age + 1` might lead to problems on some DBMS. MySQL for example can only handle column references in the `GROUP BY` and doesn't match complex expressions for the `HAVING` clause.

NOTE: Subqueries are generally not allowed in the `GROUP BY` clause, thus correlated properties/columns have to be extracted. Implicit group by generation also takes care of that.

NOTE: Due to the fact that subqueries are not allowed, the `SIZE()` function can't be used in this clause.

=== Having clause

The `HAVING` clause is similar to the <<where_clause,`WHERE` clause>> and most of the inner workings are described in the <<Predicate Builder>> chapter.
The only difference is that the `HAVING` clause in contrast to the `WHERE` clause can contain aggregate functions and is logically executed after the `GROUP BY` clause.

The API for using the `HAVING` clause is the same as for the `WHERE` clause, except that it uses `having` instead of the `where` prefix.

[source,java]
----
CriteriaBuilder<Tuple> cb = cbf.create(em, Tuple.class)
    .from(Cat.class)
    .select("age")
    .select("COUNT(*)")
    .groupBy("age")
    .having("COUNT(*)").gt(2);
----

[source,sql]
----
SELECT cat.age, COUNT(*)
FROM Cat cat
GROUP BY cat.age
HAVING COUNT(*) > :param_1
----
