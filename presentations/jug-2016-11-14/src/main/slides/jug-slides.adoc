== What is Blaze-Persistence

* Library that builds on top of JPA with deep integration
* Fluent builder API that is easy to use
* Rich pagination support integrated
* Entity-Views as painless DTOs
* Advanced SQL support on top of JPA model

== Problems with ORM/JPA

// List the problems that people have with ORMs and show the bad decisions that have to be made because of that.

* Think JPA 2.1 Entity-Graphs are too verbose?

[source,java]
----
@Entity
@NamedEntityGraph(
    name = "Cat.catWithKittensParents",
    attributeNodes = @NamedAttributeNode(value = "kittens", subgraph = "kittens"),
    subgraphs = @NamedSubgraph(name = "kittens", attributeNodes = {
        @NamedAttributeNode("father"), @NamedAttributeNode("mother")
    })
)
public class Cat {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private int id;
    private String name;
    @OneToMany
    private Set<Cat> kittens;
    @ManyToOne(fetch = Fetch.LAZY)
    private Cat mother;
    @ManyToOne(fetch = Fetch.LAZY)
    private Cat father;
}

* Fetch-problems with loading the _"whole"_ database or `LazyInitializationExceptions`?

[source,java,subs="verbatim,attributes"]

public class Cat {
    @Id @GeneratedValue
    private int id;
    private String name;
    @OneToMany(fetch = Fetch.{markstart}EAGER{markend})
    private Set<Cat> kittens;
    @ManyToOne(fetch = Fetch.{markstart}EAGER{markend})
    private Cat mother;
    @ManyToOne(fetch = Fetch.{markstart}EAGER{markend})
    private Cat father;
}

[source,java]
----
entityManager.find(Cat.class, catId);

Leading to loading all relations...

[source,java]
----
Cat c = entityManager.find(Cat.class, catId);
c.getFather().getName();
----

Leading to a `LazyInitializationExceptions` on invocation of `getName()`

<<<

* JPA constructor expressions for DTOs too inflexible?

[source,sql]
----
SELECT new com.company.somepackage.dto.MyCatDTO(
    c.name, kitten.name, father.name, mother.name
) FROM Cat c
LEFT JOIN FETCH c.kittens kitten
LEFT JOIN FETCH kitten.father father
LEFT JOIN FETCH kitten.mother mother
----

Results in flat objects, no hierarchies possible except you do something like that...

[source,java]
----
entityManager.createQuery(query, MyCatDTO.class)
    .getResultList()
    .stream()
    .collect(Collectors.groupingBy(MyCatDTO::getName, dto -> new MySubCatDTO(dto))
    .entrySet()
    .stream()
    .map(entry -> new MyMainCatDTO(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()))
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

<<<

* Missing support for that one little SQL feature that you really need?

<<<

* Having some longstanding problems with the JPA provider that don't seem to get fixed?

<<<

* Feel like you can't reuse parts of queries and have to duplicate code?
