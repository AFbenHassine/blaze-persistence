 * This Transformer runs through the expressions of the query
 * For each OUTER(pp) expression it performs an implicitJoin for the join manager
 * of the surrounding query and repalces the OUTER(pp) expression with the base node alias '.' the field.
 * 
 * We need a join manager hierarchy to do this.
 * We have decided to limit the outer statement to the join manager of the directly surrounding query so that the
 * user can specify the absolute path in a normalized form.
