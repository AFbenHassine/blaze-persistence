== Fetch strategies

// Any attribute in an entity view can be fetched separately(that's the idea, but only implemented for correlation right now)
// List the fetch strategies with a quick description
// Explain that every strategy has a valid use case but it has to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis

=== Join

// Default strategy, adds everything to the main query
// A @MappingSubquery will always use that strategy
// For correlated attributes this requires support from the JPA provider

=== Subquery

// Subquery with batching
// Careful because could lead to N + 1 selects
// Explain batching and the parameters that can be set as well as @BatchFetch
// Justify why this strategy might make sense since it uses a cache
// Explain why using VIEW_ROOT might kill performance because of limited batching capabilities

=== Subselect

// Embedds outer query into single subquery
// Quite efficient since will reuse database caches
